# Run_and_jump
### French and German versions are Aviable, just search README_FR / README_DE

## Personal project, a simple run and jump game in development:
  - Run main.py for smooth gameplay.
  - Constants.py contains all the constants.
  - Jumpnrun_register allows you to register, so you don't lose your progress in the game. All data is stored in .json files; the cache allows you to avoid having to log in each time. Logically, both are empty; they are files specific to each game.
  - Sprite.py contains the behavior of the mobs.
  - Variables.py contains all the game variables.
  - Events.py contains the events (currently zombie waves and boss spawns).
  - There are two folders (sounds, which contains the game sounds, and images, which contains the game images).

The game images are from Kenney / www.kenney.nl. Thanks to them.
